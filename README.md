# Day & Night Brightness

This is a simple [RuneLite](https://github.com/runelite/runelite) plugin for setting your client's brightness based on the current time to imitate a day and night
effect.

## How it works

When enabled, the plugin will set your brightness level when logging in.

## Configuration

You can customize the following values:

| Name                  | Default Value |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Day Time Brightness   | 30            |
| Night Time Brightness | 0             |
| Day Hour              | 8 (8.00 AM)   |
| Night Hour            | 18 (6.00 PM)  |
